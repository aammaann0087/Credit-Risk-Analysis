# üè¶ Credit Default Prediction

This project predicts the **Probability of Default (PD)** for customers using supervised machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, classification modeling, evaluation, and visualization to help financial institutions assess credit risk effectively.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face significant risk when customers default on their loans. This project aims to develop a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to default and estimate the associated probability, enabling better credit decisions.
